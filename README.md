<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

<details><summary><h3>Part 1: SetupðŸ‘·</h3></summary>

First, using Microsoft Azure, create a new virtual machine. This VM will host active directory and be using Windows Server 2022

Now create the needed admin login credentials for signing into the VM. A .rdp application will download to your PC. Upon opening the .rdp application Your admin credentials will need to be filled out every time to connect to the Azure VM.

After connecting to the RDP server Windows Server 2022 "Server Manager" should open on launch if not, it is a default application built into Windows Server 2022 so you can access it through the search bar in the bottom left, To Install Active Directory go to the Domain Controller. In "Server Manager" click on "Add roles and features."

Click "Next" until reaching the "Server Roles" section. Now, check the box next to "Active Directory Domain Services" and then "Add Features."

Next, copy and paste the script from this link into the text editor. 

https://github.com/AnthonySarmiento1/AzureActiveDirectory/blob/main/PowerShell%20Scripts/BulkUsersCreator.ps1

Choose "BulkUsersCreator.ps1".

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/GzmEkmQ.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="9"/><br />

```command line
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xCzIjyZ.png" height="65%" width="65%" alt="9"/><br />

Change the directory to "script".

```command line
cd C:\Users\tsmith\Desktop\1_CREATE_USERS.psy
```

Now, click the Run button to run the script. This will start creating domain users with usernames and passwords (The Password for these users will be "AnthonyPass")


<img src="https://i.imgur.com/RMyC0Co.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="9"/><br />

Go to Server Manager>Tools>Active Directory Users and Computers. Under the "_EMPLOYEES" tab, look at all of the users created from the script.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/f2xPlao.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="9"/><br />

These names are all randomly generated. Choose one and log into the Client VM with the username it is assigned. (Remember the password is "AnthonyPass")
