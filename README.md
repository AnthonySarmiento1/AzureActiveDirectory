First, using Microsoft Azure, create a new virtual machine. This VM will host active directory and be using Windows Server 2022

Now create the needed admin login credentials for signing into the VM. A .rdp application will download to your PC. Upon opening the .rdp application Your admin credentials will need to be filled out every time to connect to the Azure VM.

After connecting to the RDP server Windows Server 2022 "Server Manager" should open on launch if not, it is a default application built into Windows Server 2022 so you can access it through the search bar in the bottom left, To Install Active Directory go to the Domain Controller. In "Server Manager" click on "Add roles and features."

Click Next until reaching the "Confirmation" tab then click "Install." It may take a while to install. Once it says "Configuration required. Click "Close"

A window will pop up for a Configuration Wizard. Check the bubble next to "Add a new forest" then give it a domain (Example in the image below) Click next.

<details><summary><h3>Part 2: Creating Organizational Units and Groups üåÅ </h3></summary>

After installing AD, new organizational units (OU's) can be made by right-clicking on [Domain. name] > "New" > "Organizational Unit". The OU is like a container that can sort between different Users, Groups, Computers, Servers, Subnets, etc

After I made 3 OU's USA-East, USA-West, and EU to represent different office locations. Then 3 sub OU's (Computers, users, servers) to separate and organize different assets in the company.

Next, within USA-West In the "Users" OU I created a new user group to represent an IT department. along with a new user and set the username and password for that new user.

Next, copy and paste the script from this link into the text editor. 

https://github.com/AnthonySarmiento1/AzureActiveDirectory/blob/main/PowerShell%20Scripts/BulkUsersCreator.ps1

Choose "BulkUsersCreator.ps1". This Script will create a username that is the first letter of a user's first name and then the last name along with a default password that can be changed later.

Run "Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted" in the command line.

```command line
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xCzIjyZ.png" height="65%" width="65%" alt="9"/><br />

Change the directory to "script".

```command line
cd C:\Users\tsmith\Desktop\1_CREATE_USERS.psy
```

Now, click the Run button to run the script. This will start creating domain users with usernames and passwords (The Password for these users will be "AnthonyPass")
